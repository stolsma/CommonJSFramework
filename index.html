			<p>During the last 4 months I started to get involved in the world of standards for JavaScript Modules and Packages. Something I think is very important if JavaScript wants to rule the world in the next 5 years ;-) After some investigation I found out that there is a group of developers that is interested in the same thing and they already work together in a sort of Development Group called <a href="http://commonjs.org" title="The CommonJS Website" target="_new">CommonJS</a>. The only problem was that is was very difficult to get a clear overview of the direction and interaction of the current 'standards' of the group. That's why I started this post: a reference framework describing the CommonJS standards.</p>
			
			<h1>What is CommonJS</h1>
			<p>JavaScript  is a powerful object oriented language with some of the fastest dynamic  language interpreters around. The official JavaScript specification defines  APIs for some objects that are useful for building browser-based applications.  However, the spec does not define a standard library that is useful for  building a broader range of applications.</p>
			<p>So, what is  holding JavaScript back from world domination?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>JavaScript  has no module system. To compose JavaScript scripts, they must be either  managed in HTML, concatenated, injected, or manually fetched and evaluated.  There is no native facility for scope isolation or dependency management.</li>
				<li>JavaScript  has no standard library. It has a browser API, dates, and math, but no file  system API, much less an IO stream API or primordial types for binary data.</li>
				<li>JavaScript  has no standard interfaces for things like Web servers or databases.</li>
				<li>JavaScript  has no package management system that manages dependencies and automatically  installs them, except JSAN (not to be confused with JSON), which falls short  for scope isolation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The  CommonJS API will fill that gap by defining APIs that handle many common  application needs, ultimately providing a standard library as rich as those of Python,  Ruby and Java. The intention is that an application developer will be able to write an application using the CommonJS APIs and then run that application  across different JavaScript interpreters and host environments. With CommonJS-compliant systems, you can use JavaScript to write:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Server-side  JavaScript applications</li>
				<li>Command  line tools</li>
				<li>Desktop  GUI-based applications</li>
				<li>Hybrid  applications (Titanium, Adobe AIR)</li>
				<li>Browser  based Applications (User Agents)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To get order in the chaos the CommonJS Reference Framework is defined which describes the interaction between the basic CommonJS  layers:</p>
			<div style="width: 650px; height: 356px; margin: 0px auto 0px auto;" >
<a href="images/CommonJS Environment Framework v0.5.png" target="_new">
					<img src="images/CommonJS Environment Framework v0.5.png" width="650" height="356" align="middle" />
				</a>
			</div>
			<br />
			<p>In this picture three main blocks can be depicted: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Core CommonJS System with the core implementation of Modules/Packages and Context,</li>
				<li> the (extra) Module Environment where the module code every day developers are writing is running </li>
				<li>and the, with plugins extensible, asynchonous loader environment with the Specific Loader System and the Transport system to transport information/code from (remote) servers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next chapters the high level use of those layers will be described.</p>
			
			<h1>Core CommonJS System Layer</h1>
			<div style="float:right; overflow:auto; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"><a href="images/Core CommonJS Layer v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Core CommonJS Layer v0.5.png" width="200" height="181" longdesc="Layer 1 in the Architecture" /></a></div>
			<p>This is the basic CommonJS layer with stores for Module, Package and Context definitions and functions for manipulating those stores and the host environment. The total CommonJS Environment consists of an ECMAScript execution environment embedded in an application such as a web browser or scripting host, known as the host environment. In an addition to the ECMAScript interpreter, the CommonJS environment provides a facility for loading and executing ECMAScript known as the CommonJS module and package system, and bootstrapping facilities that allow us to initialize and execute CommonJS scripts.</p>
			<p>In this layer several specific subsystems can be defined, depending on the required level of implementation of CommonJS core elements (Module, Package, Context). Those subsystems work together as a sort of Matryoshka doll. The lowest level of implementation of the CommonJS System Layer is the implementation of the Module System. The second level is the use of Packages to group modules in 'package environments' for easy deployability and shareability. The last layer is the use of Contexts to be able to implement separate module/package environments in one host </p>
			<p class="EditorNote">The notion of Context is not yet defined or even discussed in the CommonJS group!! Just defined to show how easy it can be to add new functionality to the Core System Layer.</p>
			
			<p>The relation between the host environment and the core CommonJS elements are depicted in the next image:</p>
			<div style="width: 650px; height: 395px; margin: 5px auto 5px auto;" > <a href="images/Relation between Context Package and Module v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Relation between Context Package and Module v0.5.png" width="650" height="395" /></a>
			</div>
			
			<p class="EditorNote">Add distinction that in the same context environment module exports of the same module in the same package are identical. This is not the case between module exports of the same package in another context environment!! So between context environments only the Factory Function is reused not the created exports!! </p>
			
			
			<p>If we look at implementing those core elements in the Core Systems Layer we get the following picture:</p>
			<div style="width: 650px; height: 461px; margin: 5px auto 5px auto;" > <a href="images/Core CommonJS System Layer v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Core CommonJS System Layer v0.5.png" width="650" height="461" /></a>
			</div>
			
			<h2>The Context System</h2>
			<p>In the host at least one (secure) contexts will exist. A context has one (and only one) context environment. A context environment can be seen as a configurable package and its package UID is 'commonjs.org'.

In the host initialization phase at least one context will be defined. The standard configuration of that context environment will be defined in the 'Context' standards.
			The CommonJS Context System performs x main tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Creates separate module/package environments called context environments</li>
				<li>Makes it possible to switch between contexts</li>
				<li>Can create new context environments</li>
				<li>Can delete a context environment</li>
				<li>Can ??</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The context environment (with UID = 'commonjs.org') has a defined module namespace root. This is the location of which the module identifiers are resolved. This location can be a root in a database, a directory or folder in a file system or a URI to a remote or local location with context environment modules. See the newest Context/x.x specification for more information about the CommonJS Context System.</p>
			
			<h2>The Package System</h2>
			<p>The CommonJS package system performs x main tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Maps modules within packages to defined paths</li>
				<li>Stores Package definition files in a local store</li>
				<li>??</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Package Definition Store</h3>
			<p>In the Package Definition Store the static and dynamically obtained Package Descriptors are stored for later use by the other Systems. The data in the store can be used to get the Mappings field of a Package Descriptor or other package meta information.</p>
			
			<h3>Registry Store</h3>
			<p>In the Registry Store static and dynamic learned Package UID to Package URI translations are stored for later use by the Generic Loader System. The data in the store can be used to get a location for a package only referenced by a Package UID in for example the Mappings field of a loaded Package Configuration or a call to the mappings function of the Module API.</p>
			<p class="EditorNote">I've put the Registry store in this system but it could be argued to implement a seperate Registry System like Context/Package/Module Systems</p>
			
			<h2>The Module Store System</h2>
			<div style="float:right; overflow:auto; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"><a href="images/Module Store System v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Module Store System v0.5.png" width="300" height="96" longdesc="Module Environment Layer in the Architecture" /></a></div>
			<p>The CommonJS module system performs x main tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Provides module Factory Functions and dependency id's from the Module Stores to the core system on request</li>
				<li>??</li>
			</ol>
			<p><br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>The Core System</h2>
			<p>The CommonJS Core system performs x main tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Provide modules to the Module and Host Environments and memoize their exports</li>
				<li>Resolve dependencies between modules and if needed dynamically loads those dependant modules by using generic loader functions</li>
				<li>Allow host scripts to access properties exported from modules which have been provided to the environment </li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>The Generic Module System</h2>
			<p>The Generic Module System performs x main tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Provides translation functions between local module environment and the Core CommonJS System Layer (relative id to system wide canonical id translation)</li>
				<li>??</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>The Generic Loader System</h2>
			<p>&lt;Add generic description&gt;<br />
				The Generic Loader System performs x main tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Calls Module Store System  to store module definition information that is send by plugins from the Specific Loader System through the Loader API (memoize function).</li>
				<li>By request from the Generic Module System, Package System or Module Store System dynamically loads modules, package definitions or registry information by using the Loader API towards the Specific Loader System plugins (moduleLoad, packageLoad, registryLoad functions).</li>
				<li>After a {module/package/registry}Load ready callback call, loads dependent modules that are not loaded (or are not loading yet) defined in the added module definition information calls in between the {module/package/registry}Load call and the {module/package/registry}Load ready Callback by using the Loader API towards the Specific Loader System plugins. See the GenericLoader specifications for more information.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Loader API Description:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>&lt;something&gt;.id(id) : Accepts a module identifier, returning the corresponding canonical module.id</li>
				<li>&lt;something&gt;.uri(id) : Accepts a module identifier, returning a URI as a string which canonically identifies the resource</li>
				<li>&lt;something&gt;.memoize(id, dep array, module factory function) : Accepts a canonical module id, dependency array and a module factory 				function and stores that information in the dynamic module store.</li>
				<li>&lt;something&gt;.isMemoized(id) : Accepts a canonical module id, returning true if that module is available in one of the Module Store System Stores</li>
				<li>&lt;something&gt;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The module.registerPlugin function accepts an object with the following possible properties referring to an function:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>loadModule(id, readyCallback) :</li>
				<li>loadPackageDescriptor(packageUri, readyCallback):</li>
				<li>QueryRegistry(packageUID, readyCallBack):</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The registerPlugin function returns an object describing access to the Loader API functions.</p>

			<h1>Module Environment Layer</h1>
			<div style="float:right; overflow:auto; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"><a href="images/Module Environment Layer v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Module Environment Layer v0.5.png" width="200" height="181" longdesc="Module Environment Layer in the Architecture" /></a></div>
			<p>To date,  client side JavaScript has generally been able to get away with something as  simple as the &lt;script&gt; tag and no standard way to do namespaces. On the  server, it's a bit different because you're more likely to use more libraries  and you can potentially load up a lot of code. Having a basic system for  loading code and encouraging the use of namespaces to avoid unintentional  interference will underlie everything else.</p>
			<p>Minimal  requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Private  module code scope</li>
				<li>Possibility  to export module API  (i.e exports) to other modules</li>
				<li>Facility  to load module API&rsquo;s  (i.e. exports) from other modules</li>
				<li>Easy  straightforward module referencing nomenclature</li>
				<li>Declaring  dependencies on other modules by referencing them in export definition state</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A CommonJS module code section (Module Environment) is the  group of expressions contained within a module factory function. Any series of  ECMAScript expressions that can be parsed as an ECMAScript FunctionBody may be used as a module code section.<br />
				CommonJS modules may be stored as any  type of resource, including local files, remote URLs, database entries, and so  on. The storage mechanism of a module is relevant only to the environment&rsquo;s  built-in module provider and not to the defined module itself.</p>
			<p>The module environment has at a minimum access to three APIs</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The require API - The API to the module, package and context providers</li>
				<li>The exports API - The API to the modules exports</li>
				<li>The module API - The API to the generic module and package/module loader functions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Those three APIs are injected as free variables in the Module Environment via arguments in the Module Factory Function (browser hosts) or via other kind of implementations (scripting hosts).</p>
			
			
			<h1>Specific Loader System Layer</h1>
<div style="float:right; overflow:auto; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"><a href="images/Specific Loader Functions Layer v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Specific Loader Functions Layer v0.5.png" width="200" height="181" longdesc="Specific Loader Functions Layer in the Architecture" /></a></div>

			</p>
			<p class="EditorNote">How are Specific Loader System Plugins with specific loader functions coupled with the Core CommonJS System (Loader API/Generic Loader System). Think of plugins being coupled from within modules or plugins coupled from the extra module environment i.e. basic global script code</p>
			
			
			<h1>Transport System Layer</h1>
<div style="float:right; overflow:auto; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"><a href="images/Transport Protocols Layer v0.5.png" target="_new"><img src="images/Transport Protocols Layer v0.5.png" width="200" height="181" longdesc="Transport Protocols Layer in the Architecture" /></a></div>
			<p>This layer defines methods/protocols for transmitting module source code, package definitions, registry information or repository information from a (web) server to a scripting host (like a browser page).</p>
			<p>Currently defined specifications are for example: <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/AsynchronousDefinition">Packages/AsynchronousDefinition</a> or <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/Transport">Packages/Transport</a> for transporting package metadata from a remote server to a host.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
			</p>
			<p class="EditorNote">Describe some basic Transport Protocols in a high level fashion. Details must be specified in specific Transport specification documents.</p>
			
			
			<h1>Flow Examples</h1>
			<p class="EditorNote">High level Examples of flow cases. For example Module dynamically requests another module but that module is not available in exports and Module Store System so it needs to be loaded through the loader etc etc.</p>
			
			
			<h1>Glossary</h1>
			<p class="EditorNote">Here all definitions need to be inserted. Please help with definitions!!!</p>
			<ul class="Glossary">
				<li><strong>autonomous</strong>: a property of some module systems where a  module, package, or name-space provides its own name and  thus is tightly coupled to that name both internally and  to other modules, packages, or name-spaces.  CommonJS  modules are not autonomous.  RequireJS permits modules to  be optionally autonomous, by way of the define call, so  that they can be bundled.  The Simple Modules strawman for  ECMAScript Harmony allows modules to be autonomous within  a file, but the top scope of a loaded module must be named  in the loading module, so both concepts are supported.<br />
				</li>
				<li><strong>bundle</strong>: a JavaScript file that can be downloaded and  executed by a web browser using script-injection to  asynchronously load one or more modules or packages of  modules.  Lode does not presently provide a bundling  feature, but it is in the design.</li>
				<li><strong>catalog</strong>: a file on the web that describes a set of  packages.  Using a catalog reference in a package  configuration provides a level of indirection and permits  a package to be loosely coupled to its dependencies,  allowing the catalog to be updated independently of the  package.</li>
				<li><strong>compile</strong>: to transform a module in a source language, like  CoffeeScript, and produce JavaScript.</li>
				<li><strong>context</strong>: a JavaScript execution context is a container in  which a JavaScript event-loop can be executed,  guaranteeing that the array and object literal  constructors produce instances with the same particular  constructors, and providing the same primordial references  and global scope to all events.</li>
				<li><strong>cross-domain</strong>: in a web browser, a URL that has a different  domain than the containing page.  Web browsers impose  restrictions on JavaScript's ability to interact with  cross-domain resources (as in limiting the ability to use  an XMLHttpRequest), and for an iframe's ability to  interact with the containing frame's JavaScript  references.</li>
				<li><strong>define</strong>: a function name used by RequireJS and some  CommonJS proposals to permit a hand-written module to be  loaded with script-injection.  define() boilerplate,  where the last argument is a callback that receives  require, exports, and module as arguments, is  accepted by Lode to encourage interoperability with code  targetting RequireJS, but the dependency array and  optional module identifier arguments are ignored.</li>
				<li><strong>dependencies</strong>: particuarly package dependencies, including  mappings, includes, and eventually alternate module loader  packages.  In a package configuration, dependencies are  uniformly represented by the right-hand side of a  mappings item, and the contents of an includes array.</li>
				<li><strong>engine</strong>: A JavaScript embedding like NodeJS (&quot;node&quot;),  Rhino (&quot;rhino&quot;), an arbitrary web browser (&quot;browser&quot;),  or a particular web browser.  Engines provide different  classes of functionality so packages can be provided  alternate modules for different engines.</li>
				<li><strong>entry-point</strong>: the first module executed in an instance of a  working-set of packages and modules.  The entry-point is  determined by the id in pkg.require.exec(id).</li>
				<li><strong>exports</strong>: the public API of a module, represented as a  free-variable in a module, or returned by a module.</li>
				<li><strong>extension</strong>: the part of a file-name after the last dot,  &quot;.&quot;, that is presently the only mechanism for  communicating to a loader whether and how a module file  should be loaded or compiled.</li>
				<li><strong>factory</strong>: a function that executes a module.  Module  factories are called by a module loader on the first  occasion a module is required.  Having a factory permits a  module to be executed or instantiated independently of  loading.</li>
				<li><strong>free variable</strong>: a variable that is not bound in a lexical  scope and presumed to be inherited from a parent scope,  like the primordials, and other variables injected into  modules like require and exports.</li>
				<li><strong>identifier</strong>: a string that corresponds to a module in the  module-name space of a package.  Identifiers are  lower-case names using hyphens to delimit words, organized  into subtrees with slash, &quot;/&quot;, delimiters.  Identifiers  are either top-level or relative depending on whether or  not they begin with one of &quot;./&quot; or `&quot;../&quot;.</li>
				<li><strong>include</strong>: a type of dependency that gets &quot;mixed-in&quot; with  the module name space of the containing package.</li>
				<li><strong>library</strong>: a directory called &quot;lib&quot; by convention in any  of a package's roots containing modules and directories of  modules that get inducted into the top-level module  name-space of a package.</li>
				<li><strong>link</strong>: a module identifier in one package that corresponds  to a module identifier in a dependency package.</li>
				<li><strong>load</strong>: as distinct from execution, loading asynchronously  provides a module factory to a loader, sometimes for a  single module, sometimes as part of a bundle of modules or  packages.  Only when all of the modules and packages in a  working-set have been loaded can any module in that  working set be executed because a require call in any  module must be able to return the exports of the requested  module in the same turn of the event-loop.</li>
				<li><strong>loader options</strong>: an object that configures a module loader  to use particular roots in each of the loaded packages,  for example, for debug mode in a browser, or for  deployment in Node.  Different options result in different  modules being used if a package provides alternate  versions of modules.</li>
				<li><strong>loader</strong>: a device that asynchronously loads packages and  modules, permitting them to eventually be synchronously  executed.</li>
				<li><strong>main (package configuration)</strong>: in the context of a  particular package, the main module is identified by &quot;&quot;.  Whether a package has a main module and what file  corresponds to the main module identifier is the &quot;main&quot;  property of the package's configuration.</li>
				<li><strong>main (require)</strong>: In the context of executing a package, the  &quot;main&quot; module is the entry-point for the execution of a  working-set of packages and modules.  In the scope of any  module, require.main is the module object in the scope  of the main module.</li>
				<li><strong>mapping</strong>: a kind of dependency where the top-level module  name-space of an external package gets integrated into a  sub-tree of the dependent package's name-space.</li>
				<li><strong>module</strong>: a file that has its own, sovereign lexical scope  and may require and provide exports from and to other  modules using the require and exports free variables,  and the return statement.  A module receives a module  free variable with meta-data like the module's identifier.</li>
				<li><strong>name-space</strong>: the module identifier name-space is a set of  top-level identifiers scoped to a package, where some  identifiers are linked to modules within the package, and  others to dependency packages.</li>
				<li><strong>package configuration</strong>: the package.json of a package,  containing its configuration information, particularly how  it should be linked to other packages and described to  package registries and catalogs.</li>
				<li><strong>package</strong>: a directory or archive of a directory with a  package configuration file at its root (package.json),  various roots, libraries within roots, and modules within  libraries.</li>
				<li><strong>primordial</strong>: any of the objects intrinsic to a context like  the global object and Object and Array constructors.</li>
				<li><strong>registry</strong>: a web service for searching, downloading, and  posting packages.</li>
				<li><strong>relative</strong>: a class of module identifier that begins with  &quot;./&quot; or &quot;../&quot; indicating that the corresponding module  should be resolved relative to the current module's  top-level identifier.</li>
				<li><strong>require</strong>: a function provided as a free-variable to  CommonJS modules that permits the module to acquire the  exports of another module.</li>
				<li><strong>root</strong>: the top-most directory of a package is the root,  but there may be others depending on the loader options,  for example, including the {root}/engines/{engine}  directory of any other root and configured engine name  like node or browser, and the {root}/debug directory  of any other root if a loader is configured for debugging.  Roots are prioritized from most to least specific and  searched for resources, particularly but not limited to  library directories where modules are found.</li>
				<li><strong>script-injection</strong>: a technique for asynchronously  downloading and executing potentially cross-domain  JavaScript in a web browser.</li>
				<li><strong>SES5</strong>: secure ECMAScript 5 is a subset of ECMAScript 5 (a  specification for the class of languages including  JavaScript) where all of the primordials are immutable (by  virtue of being frozen) and other invariants are  maintained to prevent the lexical scope and primordials in  any event from being suberted by another event, and to  permit mutually suspicious programs to run in the same  event loop without interference except possibly  denial-of-service.</li>
				<li><strong>sovereign</strong>: pertaining to a lexical-scope, means that a  module is not coupled to other modules using a shared  lexical scope, and thus is safe from contamination and  pollution of other modules.  CommonJS modules have  sovereignty over their lexical scope.  Pertaining to the  module identifier-name space, means that a package is not  implicitly coupled to other packages, using a shared  package name-space, and thus is safe from contamination  and polution of other packages.  Lode packages have  sovereignty over their module name-space, but may elect to  be coupled to specific packages through includes and  mappings.  Node packages do not have sovereignty; they are  subject to the module identifier name-spaces provided to  them by Node and other packages.  NPM makes an effort to  guarantee consistent linkage to dependencies, but does not  provide sovereignty.  Narwhal packages do not have  sovereignty; they are subject to the module identifier  name spaces of all installed packages.</li>
				<li><strong>top-level</strong>: as distinguished from &quot;relative&quot;, a top-level  module identifier is one that does not start with a &quot;./&quot;  or a &quot;../&quot;, indicating that a module is linked relative  to the root of the module name-space, &quot;&quot;.</li>
				<li><strong>turn</strong>: the execution of an event in JavaScript. The  JavaScript event-loop arranges for events to be executed in turns, with only one stack of execution at any time.</li>
				<li><strong>working set</strong>: given a package, the transitive closure of  all packages that any package in the set depends upon.  Given a module, the transitive closure of all modules that  any module in the set requires.  Because require must be  able to return an exports object in the same turn, and  if loading must be asynchronous, the working set of  CommonJS modules must be loaded before any module in the  working set is executed or instantiated.</li>
			</ul>
